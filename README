This is a Bashscript to get the departure time for the stops in Dresden. It is intended for those who don't want/can't use a graphical departure-monitor.

What you need is the Bash (tested with version 4.2.20) and wget.

Planned features:
	* better erroroutput (especially at connectionproblems)
	* more cities (currently only Dresden)

If you have a stop you use are regularly you can set it in the script (it's the variable "stop").
